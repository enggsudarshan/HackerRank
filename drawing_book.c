/*
Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their -page book to page number . 
Brie can either start turning pages from the front of the book (i.e., page number ) or from the back of the book (i.e., page number ), 
and she always turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at once). 
When she opens the book, page  is always on the right side:

Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page which may only have a 
front side depending on the total number of pages of the book (see the Explanation sections below for additional diagrams).

Given  and , find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page .
